# FoodDelivery-Website
This is a **Full Stack Food Ordering Web Application** built with **React JS**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Stripe Payment Gateway**. The app enables users to browse food items, add them to a shopping cart, place orders, and complete payments through Stripe. The app also includes an **Admin Panel** for managing food items and viewing orders.

## Features:
- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and log out using a secure authentication system.
- **Food Catalog:** Users can view a list of available food items and browse by category.
- **Shopping Cart:** Users can add food items to their cart, modify quantities, and proceed to checkout.
- **Order Management:** Users can place orders and view order status updates.
- **Stripe Integration:** Secure online payment system using **Stripe** to complete transactions.
- **Admin Panel:** Admins can manage food items (add, edit, delete) and view order details.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.

## Technologies Used:
- **Frontend:** React JS (with Hooks), React Router
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Payment Gateway:** Stripe API
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication
- **Styling:** CSS, SCSS (or a UI framework like Material UI or Bootstrap)
- **Deployment:** Can be deployed on platforms like Heroku, Netlify, or AWS.

## How to Run Locally:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
    - `cd backend && npm install`
    - `cd frontend && npm install`
3. Set up environment variables for Stripe API keys and MongoDB.
4. Run both frontend and backend locally:
    - `npm run server` (in the backend directory)
    - `npm run dev` (in the frontkend directory)
5. Open `http://localhost:5173` and `http://localhost:5174` in your browser to view the app.

## Key Skills Gained:
- **React Development:** Building interactive UIs and handling user interactions efficiently.
- **Backend Development:** Developing RESTful APIs, setting up routes, and integrating MongoDB for data storage.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Implementing secure user authentication using JWT.
- **Payment Integration:** Integrating **Stripe** for processing payments securely.
- **Full Stack Development:** Managing both frontend and backend, ensuring seamless communication between the client-side and server-side.
- **Admin Panel Development:** Designing an admin interface for food and order management.

## Conclusion:
This project showcases a complete, fully functioning food ordering system with secure payment integration and user management, providing a comprehensive demonstration of my full-stack development capabilities.
